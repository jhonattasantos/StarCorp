Challenge - Backend Developer

Using SOLID principles, write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print “StarCorp”. For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “StarCorpianos”.

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary operators or `else`.

# Requirements

* 1 if

* You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary

* Unit tests

* You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at StarCorp we are big fans of PHP.
